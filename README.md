## _Overview_
Following up on the [*Visualising Data in Football project*](https://github.com/Hamza-149/visualizing-data-in-football), I built an interactive dashboard using Streamlit and other libraries. This user-friendly dashboard will allow users to freely interact with the analysis I've carried out so far, making it easy to interpret the visualisations and charts without having to go through all the code.

## _Tournaments Analysed_
- FIFA World Cup
- UEFA Euro
- Copa América
- African Cup of Nations
- AFC Asian Cup

- ## _Tech Stack_
- Python (analysis)
- Plotly (visualisations)
- Streamlit (dashboard)

## _References_
- The [*dataset*](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017) we used for our analysis was obtained from [*Kaggle*](https://www.kaggle.com/).
- To clean some of our data that we extracted from kaggle we cross-referenced it with the data available on Wikipedia.
- [*Jupyter notebook*](https://github.com/Hamza-149/visualizing-data-in-football) where we carried out all the cleaning and analysis.
